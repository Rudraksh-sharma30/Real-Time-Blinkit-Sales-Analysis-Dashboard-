🚀I recently designed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze Blinkit's sales performance and business trends.

✨Dashboard Highlights:

💰Total Sales - $1.20M

🛍️Total Items - 8,523

🌟Average Rating - 4.0

📈Average Sales - $141

🔍Key Insights:

• Tier 3 outlets achieved the highest sales at $472.1K.

• High-sized outlets generated the largest revenue share.

• Regular fat products accounted for 65% of sales.

• Top-performing categories: Fruits & Vegetables, Snack Foods, and .Household Items

• Sales growth peaked in 2018, showing a strong upward trend
